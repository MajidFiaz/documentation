To assign a version number follow the guidance below. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the: MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner. PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes. Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.                                                                                                 |
