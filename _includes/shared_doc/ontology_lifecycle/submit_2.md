Once the semantic artefact is submitted, users can immediately access the metadata, whereas the classes/properties indexing takes place asynchronously and it might be scheduled overnight. When the parsing of the semantic artefact is completed, an email is sent to the administrators of the semantic artefact. The whole submission should be completed by the next day; if not, please send an email to the support team (semantics@lifewatch.eu).
