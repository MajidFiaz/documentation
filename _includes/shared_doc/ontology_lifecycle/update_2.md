**Edit submission**

The editing of semantic artefacts metadata can be performed in two ways: edits of a specific version of the resource (“Pencil” button on the bottom left corner, Figure 45.2), edits of the latest submission (“Pencil” button on the top right corner, Figure 45.1). __It is not possible to change the semantic artefact acronym because EcoPortal uses this field as a primary key and identifier__. Once the form is edited, click on the "Save" button. If the "Location" settings are not changed,  only the metadata changes will be saved.
