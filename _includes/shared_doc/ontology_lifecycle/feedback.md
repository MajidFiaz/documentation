### Give feedback on {{ page.atoms }}
EcoPortal includes some community-oriented features in the notes such as: (i) comments that can be attached in a forum-like mode to a specific artefact or class/concept, in order to discuss different specifications of the semantic artefact (its design, use, or evolution) or allow users to propose changes, and (ii) proposals that can be submitted within the portal.
Administrators encourage the users to engage in giving feedback on semantic artefacts since each input is valuable in developing and publishing community-approved resources.
