### Submit new {{ page.atoms }}

In order to publish a semantic artefact, you need to sign up for an account at the EcoPortal website:
- Login EcoPortal: [link](http://ecoportal.lifewatchitaly.eu/login?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fecoportal.lifewatchitaly.eu%2F)

Logged in users can navigate to the [Browse page](http://ecoportal.lifewatchitaly.eu/ontologies) and click the [Submit a semantic artefact](http://ecoportal.lifewatchitaly.eu/ontologies/new) button. The submission form requires to fill out some metadata about the submitted semantic artefact as shown in Figure 43:

- *Viewing restriction*: choose if the submitted resource is public (all users, even unregistered users, can see it) or private. 
- *Categories*: select the categories to which the resource belongs to improve the search tools.
- *Groups*: select the groups to which the resources belong. Groups associate ontologies from the same project or organisation, for better identification of the provenance
- *View*: check "this semantic artefact is a view of" to create a new semantic artefact as a [view]() of a semantic artefact selected from the drop-down field.
- *URI*: The URI of the semantic artefact which is described by this metadata.
- *Description*: description of the semantic artefact.
- *Representation* language: the model used to create the semantic artefact (e.g. SKOS, OWL, OBO).
- *Status*: semantic artefact release status: **alpha**, the semantic artefact is actively in development after the previous release and being tested internally; **beta**, the semantic artefact is feature-complete and being tested internally; **production**, the semantic artefact has passed all stages of verification and test; retired, the semantic artefact is no longer supported or is obsolete, and it will not be implemented any more.
- *Location*: the place from which the semantic artefact is retrieved: **Metadata Only**, choose this option if you want users to search and view only the semantic artefact metadata; **Load from URL**, new versions loaded daily; **Upload Local File**, choose a file from the local file system to upload the semantic artefact.
- *Date* of the original creation: date of the semantic artefact first release.
- *Contact*: details of a contact person (name and email).

Once the mandatory fields are completed, click on the "Finish" button in order to generate the summary page of the semantic artefact. Then click on the pencil button on the top right side of the summary page (Figure 45) to edit metadata and add more information about the semantic artefact (Figure 44).

To request the DOI, you can check the box “*Check this box if your asset has no PID and you want to request a DOI*”, which can be found in the “Other identifier” metadata field.
LifeWatch ERIC is a member of [DataCite](https://datacite.org/) and it can provide a [Digital Object Identifier (DOI)](https://www.doi.org/) to semantic artefacts that do not have one. DOIs allow semantic artefacts to be cited in scientific publications or elsewhere in a reliable and sustainable way. EcoPortal assigns a DOI only upon verification and validation of the semantic artefact. The DOI is connected to the metadata of the resource as well as to its digital location (e.g. the URL) where all the details about the resource are available.
For more detailed information about metadata properties, refer to the General Information of the Metadata schema table.
