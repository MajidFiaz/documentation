**Add submission**

From this section, located at the top right corner (see Figure 45.1), the semantic artefact manager(s) can upload a new version of the existing semantic artefact and update the metadata using one of the following two options:
- If in the original submission was set up an automatic update of the resource from a source URL, EcoPortal examines the content of this URL nightly, and re-submits the content if it has changed. If the updated submission does not parse, the semantic artefact manager(s) will be notified via email;
- If in the original submission was not set up an automatic update of the resource, or if the semantic artefact manager(s) want to immediately update the semantic artefact, they can upload the new version directly by selecting a local file. The upload process starts and the semantic artefact will be parsed shortly thereafter. Semantic artefact manager(s) can at this point also change the settings and enable the automatic update of the resource. The semantic artefact parsing is completed within an hour maximum with the exception of large semantic artefacts, whereas semantic artefact indexing and automatic mapping occur overnight.
