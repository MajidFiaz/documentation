### SKOS Support

**Support for SKOS vocabularies in {{page.portal}}**
{{ page.portal }} serves as a web-based portal designed for the access and exchange of semantic artefacts. The platform is capable of receiving semantic artefact submissions in OWL and OBO formats, as well as SKOS vocabularies containing specific constructs. This guide outlines the essential set of SKOS constructs required in a vocabulary for proper acceptance and handling within EcoPortal. It is important to emphasise that the described SKOS constructs are specifically processed for vocabularies identified as SKOS during their submission to EcoPortal.
