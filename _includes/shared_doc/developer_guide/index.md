All the content that the EcoPortal uses (and more!) is available via REST services by means users can:
- access all EcoPortal semantic artefacts, their different versions, and metadata for those versions;
- access information about any semantic artefact concept in EcoPortal (with definitions, synonyms, and other properties);
- search across all semantic artefacts in EcoPortal;
- get hierarchy information for EcoPortal semantic artefacts (such as parents, children, or siblings of a class, roots or leaves of a class hierarchy).
