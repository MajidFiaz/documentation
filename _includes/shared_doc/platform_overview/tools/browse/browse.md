The Browse tool allows users to search for semantic artefacts. When opening the browser page (Figure 3), there are two options:
1. scroll the full list of semantic artefacts and select one to see more detailed information (Browse all);
2. type the semantic artefact name or abbreviation in the Search bar.

![Browser Page]({{site.figures_link}}/{{page.portal}}/Figure3.png)

In both cases, the search can be further refined by using the filters provided on the left side of the page (Show semantic resource views, Show retired semantic resources, Categories, Groups, Natural languages, Formality levels, Semantic resource types). Upon selecting the filter, the search will be updated to show results which contain the selected filter. Repeat the process to add additional filters.

Moreover, using the tabs on the right side of the search bar, the list of semantic artefacts can be sorted by choosing the type of format (SKOS, OWL, UMLS, OBO) or other desired criteria:

- _Name_: alphabetical order;
- _Classes count_: number of classes;
- _Instances/concepts count_: number of instances or concepts;
- _Submitted date_: date of last submission;
- _Creation date_: date of publication;
- _FAIR score_: O’FAIRe tool score;
- _Popularity_: number of visits to the semantic artefact;
- _Notes_: number of notes issued for the semantic artefacts;
- _Projects_: number of projects where semantic artefacts are used.

To access semantic artefacts through the API, see our [Resources REST API documentation]().

In the browse page, the “Submit new semantic artefact” button is also available on the upper-left part of the page, but users need to be logged in to perform this operation.
