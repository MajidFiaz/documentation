The Mappings tool enables the association of two or more terms in different semantic artefacts, typically indicating a degree of similarity between them. The author of the mapping defines its relation; in addition, although not required, it is usually recommended for a mapping to be bi-directional.

To upload mappings, use the “Upload mappings” button. A valid file format example is available. You can either select the file or drag and drop it into the box.

Mappings can be searched in two ways:

- Find mappings of classes/concepts from the “Bubble view”. Each bubble is a semantic artefact and its size represents the number of mappings available (Figure 6). After selecting two semantic artefacts, a box will appear displaying the mappings between those two artefacts (Figure 7). Select the desired class/concept to view a table with the same information as shown [here](). 
- Browse mappings between classes/concepts in different semantic artefacts from the “Table view” by selecting the semantic artefact from the drop-down menu. The results table will show all the semantic artefacts to which the selected resource is mapped with and the number of existing mappings (minimum one) (Figure 8). Select a semantic artefact from this table to browse the mappings between the two semantic artefacts.

To access mappings from the API, please see our [Mappings REST API documentation]().
