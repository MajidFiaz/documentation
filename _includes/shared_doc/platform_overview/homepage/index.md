## Homepage

The {{ page.portal }} homepage (Figure 1) consists of:
- a header containing the logo on the left and the [navigation bar]() on the right;
- a [search bar]() to quickly search for terms or for semantic artefacts by entering a free text. The autocomplete functionality will support the quest by suggesting terms or semantic artefacts available within the portal;
- some statistical information, provided as bubbles cloud, indicating the number of visits for the EcoPortal semantic artefacts;
- EcoPortal metrics such as number of published resources, number of classes, etc.;
- a [recommender]() and [annotator]() box;
- the [Oâ€™FAIRe]() tool with the average FAIR score of the semantic artefacts published within EcoPortal;
- a news box displaying the most recent posts of LifeWatch ERIC;
- the links to other OntoPortal instances;
- the EcoPortal collaborations and support;
- a [footer]() containing additional supporting information and documentation.
