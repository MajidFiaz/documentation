### Views
This area displays the semantic artefactâ€™s views and allows the creation of new ones. A view is a manageable portion of a larger semantic artefact that is tailored for specific applications and users.
When creating a view, the system:
- allows the precise extraction of subsets from a larger resource;
- allows to personalise and use portion of a resource;
- facilitates interoperability between subsets of large semantic artefacts and specific applications.
Each displayed view is linked for an easy consultation.
