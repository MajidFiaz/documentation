#### FAIR Score

The FAIR score displayed as “Total score” is specific for the semantic artefact. By selecting the details button, as illustrated in Figure 13, users can explore sets of questions associated with each FAIR Sub-principle, along with their corresponding credits and utilised metadata properties (refer to Figure 14). The system then automatically computes the score.
