### Check Resolvability application

For each URIs available in the user interface, EcoPortal provides three options (Figure 28.1):
- __“Copy original URI”;__
- __“Copy EcoPortal URI”__. For each URIs, EcoPortal generates automatically an analog ‘EcoPortal URI’ that does support HTTP content resolution and negotiation in 4 formats (JSON, XML, Turtle, N-Triple) and also HTML, bringing the users directly to the corresponding Web page in EcoPortal. These new URIs do not replace the original URI, and are not made to be used externally except to redirect the original URIs (when they are not resolvable and/or negotiable). On the semantic artefact summary page, in the Identifiers box, the EcoPortal URI (chain symbol), when clicked, will display the instructions (for Apache and Nginx Web servers) to use for the domain name redirections, if needed;
- __URI resolvability check__. This last option checks if the original URI is resolvable and negotiable (Figure 28.2, i.e., support HTTP content negotiation and return alternative formats). Users can “click to see details” and be moved to EcoPortal new Check Resolvability application (Figure 28.2).
