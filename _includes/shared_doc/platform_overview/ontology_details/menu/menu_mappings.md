### Mappings
The Mappings tab displays the mappings computed by EcoPortal for the selected resource, grouped by semantic artefact (Figure 22). The page includes a table with two columns: “Semantic artefact” and “Mappings” and a bubble plot. The first column identifies the semantic artefact to which the selected resource is mapped, and the second column shows the number of mappings. By clicking on a semantic artefact all the mappings are shown (Figure 23).
